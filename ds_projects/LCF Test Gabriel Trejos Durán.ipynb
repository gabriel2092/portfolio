There are also different ranges of values, especially with the total charges and should be normalized before modeling. In terms of monthly charges most clients are paying monthly charges less than $30. \n",

    "One variable that is potentially associated with the churn rates is tenure. Looking at the bimodal distribution it looks like the company is good at capturing new clients and has a good number of loyal ones but it is having a hard retaining after a year. Additionally, it looks like less than 15% of the total number of clients are non senior. One potential assumption is that younger clients could have an impact in the tenure of contracts and thus the churn rate, but without age information is also hard to segregate the over 5000 non senior citizens. \n"

Looking at the churn rate among senior citizens is higher compared to non senior citizens, although in absolute terms, the amount of non senior citizens is very little compared to non.

    "Looking at the the graph, it can be observed that costumers with tenures less than a year have the highest churn rate, with almost half of the clients churning. Tenure seems to have a negative correlation with Churn Rates i.e. the higher the tenure, the lower the churn rate. If we add this to the fact that the type of contract with highest churn rates is the month to month, one could hypothesize that clients are dropping within the first year, which could indicate the quality service is not sufficient to renew after a year or cancel it before. \n",

In terms of total charges, clients with less than 500 dollars in total charges show a significant more likelihood of canceling the services that with any other bracket. Given that total charges are a function of tenure, this makes sense that it is also a variable with potential predictive power. Also, it shows that these variables are highly correlated between them."

By looking at the features, one possibility to improve the model in future iterations is to drop some of the features with no predictive power such as the support services, that could potentially be affecting the model's perfomance by making it to complex to generalize the data. Also it would be important to address the issue of multicolinearity with variables such as tenure and total charges, among others."

By using the Lime library, the potential client could understand the key features for each of the class predictions as well as their weights. For instance one of the testing dataset, the user can see that the model predicted that a customer with this permuation of features is 86% likely to churn and the feature with the highest weight to explain this probability is the Fiber Optic. \n",

Given that Fiber Services are       within that price range, this could be one of the services the client is not satisfied with. "

    "Use Metadata: We know from the model that month to month contracts have the highest predictive power in terms of churning. However, this does not give us a root cause as to why month to month clients churn more than long term. We could potentially work with the company to conduct customer surveys or complaints, and perform some text analytics to identify what are the real drivers behind the high churn rates for month to month contracts. This could give us more insights on the customer experience with each of the services and the perceived quality of each. Concomitantly, more demographic data can be gathered such as the age of the customers, location, reason for acquiring services, etc. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Treat Multicolinearity: I did not treat the model for multicollinearity, but it is very likely that different variables are highly correlated. For example, tenure and total charges are probably highly correlated, given that one variable is part of the function of the other. A similar case is for all the techsupport services  that might have some degree of multicollinearity, with clients opting these services together or even offered as a bundle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timestamps: The analysis done is static in time. We do not know the time context of the data and whether there are seasonal patterns with churn. This dataset could be at the beginning of the year or after a big campaign to capture new clients."
